I started by basing my code for the basics of the website off of the first challenge.
I then went on to go through the module 2 challenge requirments and tried to do them to the best of my capabilities.
I made mistakes at first when i was creating classes, It seemed as though I was groupimg too many things into one class, not giving me enough control over specifics of containers, text, pictures, etc.
After awhile I decided to create more classes and classes inside of those classes (subclasses), so that I had more control over the properties I wanted to add in CSS.
I also created two branches to edit on, those being; feature/flexbox(which I struggled with flexbox on) and another branch, develop.
After creating these branches, I used them both for different editing purposes at first and then went on to use mainly the feature/flexbox branch for changes I wanted to test.
While using a branch for editing. I added links and hover to photos for the About Me photo and the photos for My Work photos.
After adding links to the photos, I had to reaarange the layout of my page to look how I wanted it to look by playing with borders and spacing.
After I was done editing my webpage on my secondary branch, I merged it to my Main branch to add the changes to my main files in my Github repository.
Before publishing my page, I had to delete my directory folder, because I couldn't get my repository to publish. I deleted my folder but added the individual css and html files to my repository.
The Branch I published was my Main branch, using the /root directory.
